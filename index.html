  Hello World

<p>
  HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language is used for creating web pages. It has many functions like describing the structure of a web page, it tells the browser how it should display the content, and has many different elements and components. HTML elements also lable pieces of content.

  I chose to take this class, Web Page Design, because I think it will be beneficial for me in the future. I am interested in business, and I think that learning more about Web Pages will be able to help me with not only my future, but life in general because we never know where we may end up in the future, or what we may end up doing. I hope to learn more and expand my knowledge in web page design because I have always found it interesting.
